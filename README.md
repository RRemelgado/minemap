## Refining data on mining occurrences

<p align="justify">
Maus et al created the first database of the spatial extent of mining areas by mobilizing nearly 20 years of Landsat data. This dataset is imperative for GlobES, as mining areas are specified in the IUCN habitat class scheme. Yet, this dataset is temporally static. To tackle this flaw, we mined the Landsat archive to infer the first observable year of mining.
